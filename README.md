A relatively simple bank server with security features.

It currently stops CSRF attacks and requires a login for most APIs

In order to test it you're going to need an X-XSRF-TOKEN header, said token is currently generated
by the server but in practice would be generated by the frontend trying to communicate with the server
(Javascript has functions allowing it to make them)

Cookies are also not secure but that's for local testing. Secure cookies will only work on websites using https
which is too difficult to accomplish locally to be worth it.

There are 3 base users (one of each role) but these aswell would be removed in proper projects or when
the project goes up on a cloud.

The project can be run in docker. You will need to add a BankSecurity.env file with the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
being your own root password

ROLE FUNCTIONALITIES:

CUSTOMER: open savings account, start transaction with another customer, add money to main account,
remove money from main account, transfer money from main account to selected savings account,
